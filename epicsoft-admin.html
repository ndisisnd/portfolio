                <h1>A GUI for Inventory Management</h1>
                <p>After shipping the <a>consumer-facing designs for OhMai,</a> the OhMai
                   platform was only 50% done. The age of directly injecting orders into SQL
                   or cleaning up payment gateway data in MongoDB is over. The business development
                   team at Epicsoft Asia needed something that was more efficent to manage than
                   their previous e-commerce endeavours.</p>
                   <br>
                <p>I was part of this ambitious project to design, test, and ship complete designs
                   within a month.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>The Challenge</p>
                <h1>Building an internal enterprise platform in 1 month</h1>
                <p>Our goal for this project was to make e-commerce make sense. 
                   The premise was simple: anyone at Epicsoft can add a product, fulfill an order,
                   and refund customers without scratching their heads and reading a manual one too
                   many times. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The ambition was to build something that was beyond what other e-commerce giants
                   have already figured out. We're not reinventing the wheel, but rather, innovating
                   on the best practices and information architecture on the shoulders of giants.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>As the solo designer on the team, I led the project and collaborated with three engineers,
                   one project manager, and testing with two of Epicsoft's designated OhMai admins.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>This platform is currently being implemented by engineers and will be shipped by mid-May 2021.</p>

            <h1>Making sense of prior knowledge</h1>
            <p>As a stranger to the e-commerce world, I had to familiarise myself quickly with how
               the inventory system works in e-commerce. <br>
               <br>This means everything from charge IDs to HS Code in shipping.
               I gathered the main stakeholders in Epicsoft Asia and other people who previously collaborated on 
               e-commerce projects in the past and jotted down their thoughts. I then dived into their numerous Excel sheets,
               their data nomenclature in SQL and even the payment gateway API documentation. I then organised these notes
               into a simple architecture on what goes into a product, which gave me a starting point for crafting questions for further user research.
               <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>Based on this, I could also reasonably create a simple flowchart of what sort of functions our admins need.</p>

                    <p>
                        Epicsoft Asia previously used many different variations of e-commerce backend dashboards
                        that are well-established, but it was hard to stick to any of them. These dashboards mostly
                        included irrelevant functions that they didn't need, which were all part of the overall UX flow
                        that rendered them having to click more just to get to the page they want. This created a lot of
                        cognitive fatigue.

                        Not everyone wants to see the SKU all the time, but there is information that they would want to
                        keep shown when they log in. Most of the team are using Notion for sprint planning and data organisation
                        and they loved how Notion structured their UX.

                <p>Nobody wanted to guess what an icon means or a button does. I made sure functions are explicit and
                    ensured that it was a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) platform.

                <h2>Prioritising speed and overviews</h2>
                <p>Everyone wanted to "see everything". Because of this, I focused a lot on ensuring that critical information 
                    is always present above the fold. Using the journalism Inverted Pyramid for newswriting as inspiration,
                    I broke down how a product is actually tagged and given detail in the way that makes most sense to the admins.

                <h2>Non-adherence to the Design System</h2>
                <p>The previous design system that I used for the OhMai consumer-facing platform had to be adapted,
                    and I created a separate design system set just for backend use. This was an oversight on my end: I
                    treated the adminstrative dashboards as a product bundled with OhMai, but rather, I should be treating it
                    as a separate product on its own.

                <h2>Engineering Constraints</h2>
                <p>With such a short deadline, I had to constantly adapt the design to ensure that the engineers
                    could deliver on time. This was coupled with some communication difficulty with an outsourced developer
                    from Jakarta.

            <h1>Post-Launch Reflections</h1>
            <p>After shipping this platform to the engineers, I understood why UI/UX designers need to be extremely perceptive,
               and that at times you have to take the risk with certain design patterns. General feedback after some user tests
               were great, and all the admins found a 70% reduction in the amount of time they spent adding a product as compared
               to other brands. It was also aesthetically pleasing and consistent with the main theme.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I learnt that it was extremely important to test enterprise software with the people that use it most. It was also
                a good choice to lay out the information architecture early so that engineers can give feedback on what 
                constraints there are. Early feedback on potential technical challenges allowed me to make changes to the design quickly
                so as to stick to the previously set deadline of one month.
