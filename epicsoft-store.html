                <h1>Transforming boring e-commerce to interactive visuals</h1>
                <p>There's games to sell, there's people that'll buy it. The problem is
                   that all around Asia, there are de facto e-commerce platforms that people already use.
                   These e-commerce platforms are evolving every day with huge teams of UX designers that
                   know what will convert every user into a customer. To launch into an oversaturated
                   Taiwan market, we needed to make a huge splash.
                </p>
                   <br>
                <p>I was part of this ambitious project to design, test, and ship complete designs
                   within two months.

                <p>The Challenge</p>
                <h1>Hypothesising, Understanding, Designing and Shipping an Experience</h1>
                <p>With a plethora of e-commerce platforms, it's easy to find design patterns that are tried and tested.<br><br>
                   My challenge was to innovate on this: how can I discover what makes an experience? What do people like
                   about shopping that makes them keep coming back to a platform? I had many questions that needed answering,
                   and the target users were in a foreign market that I have not interacted with before. The lack of cultural insight,
                   easy access to resources, and communication barriers made the Empathy process a pain.

                <p>Pulling heads together</p>
                <h1>Understanding internal insights in Epicsoft</h1>
                <p>At Epicsoft, the business development team has worked extensively with the Taiwan and Hong Kong market, and thus hold
                   many insights that may potentially be useful. I requested for a meeting and gathered the team, went over the specs, and
                   asked for any internal insights that may help in this project. I ran a remote affinity mapping exercise on Figma and
                   pieced together a mindmap.

                <p>Experience vs. E-commerce</p>
                <h1>It's more than e-commerce</h1>
                <p>It's easy to say "build something that's not e-commerce, but still e-commerce", but the fact is almost every e-commerce platform
                   that's popular to the Taiwan and Hong Kong market looks like carbon copies or variants of Shopee and Lazada. Using the insights
                   from my colleagues, I knew what I needed to go against the grain.

                <p>Building v0</p>
                <h1>Dark Mode e-commerce</h1>
                <p>Going along the lines of game-related platforms/websites such as cs.money, Discord, Twitch, and Steam, I hypothesised that going for
                   dark mode would be the most ideal. These are mostly gamers that we're targeting: they usually browse at night with very minimal light,
                   and having a dark mode design would suit their browsing style.
                </p>
                <p>I took inspiration from other e-commerce platforms and incorporated the tried and tested designs patterns that they already have,
                   and created the first iteration of OhMai after two weeks of prototyping.

                <h1>Entire designs scrapped</h1>
                <p>I had access to a pool of Taiwan users as one of our contacts who could make the project possible is based in Taipei. Utilising his network,
                   I scheduled a few remote user tests and gathered their initial feedback from a pool of 25 people. This was followed by another test with internal
                   stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the designs were scrapped. According to feedback, the website was "boring" and "liveless". I dove deeper into this and dug into why
                   they considered the wesite boring. The lack of interactions, visual stimulus, and "shock factor" led me to understand that I needed to work on the visual design.

                <p>Change in Project Management style</p>
                <h1>From waterfall to agile</h1>
                <p>Previously, the directive always came from the executives, which funnelled down to our PM. The issue is that we treated each task as a blocker to another: I had to complete
                   the overall product page design before working on a single product page. That's cool—but that led to the vehement rejection from before. We needed a way to work concurrently,
                   and test things in parallel. Hence, the project manager decided to adopt an Agile methodology with the tech team and soon I was back on the familiar cycle of
                   standups, retrospectives, and assigning tasks to myself.

                <p>Testing v0.5 in a sprint</p>
                <h1>Since they are gamers, why not make a game UI?</h1>
                <p>Inspired by gaming HUDs (Heads-up Display) that show character statistics and equipment, why not make a platform that's similar to that? Imagine
                   an experience where users come on the platform and buy something for themselves as if they are in a game—they are the game character. 
                   With this, I decided to create a concept for the KOL storefront page and tested it with a new set of Taiwanese customers (who were previous customers of Play-E).

                <p>It was an interesting concept, but the users had a few frustrations:

                <ul>
                    <li>What was the point of this page? What am I doing here when I land on this page?</li>
                    <li>Where can I buy things on the KOL storefront?</li>
                    <li>How do I get to another section in the KOL storefront page?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I had my fair share of good feedback, which I used for the next sprint:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>People liked vibrant colours that look active</li>
                    <li>Traditional, flat user interface design makes the website the same as everything else</li>
                    <li>People usually use the same sites over and over again</li>

                    glassmorphism as a base? I opted for a new background, and created a whole new design system surrounding 
                    this concept. I aimed to create an experience whilst balancing the purpose of the platform: users are here
                    to purchase things. My objective was to not make them feel like they're here just for that.

                <h1>A whole new world</h1>
                <p>I tested the first storefront concept with the KOLs themselves. My objective was to answer these few questions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do they feel like it represented them?</li>
                        <li>Do they feel compelled to promote the page?</li>
                        <li>Do they feel that the storefront was something they would be proud to have?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>With a pool of 7 different KOLs from different regions in Taiwan, I managed to gather enough feedback to iterate
                    on the storefront. Subsequently, I iterated on the previous v0 designs and created a whole new set.

                    carefully since there was not much time left to test with users, considering that the Design team is just myself. To manage this,
                    I decided to segment out the modules that have "innovative UX" or less orthodox flows, then test a bunch of them over a few days
                    with another set of customers. 
                </p>

                <h1>A breathless execution</h1>
                <p>The extremely tight deadline made working on this project a huge breathless run. Each sprint felt like I was trying to achieve a triathlon
                    in one day—thrice. I had to take into account many factors that were mostly uncontrollable: engineering constraints and
                    business development concerns. 
                </p>
                <p>One thing I would do differently would be to lay out a design system very early on that was more modular. I was under a wrong impressiong that
                    I could simply ship v0—and the horror came in when I had to overhaul the design system. That led to a lot of delays especially with tweaking
                    colours, typography, and components throughout Figma.
